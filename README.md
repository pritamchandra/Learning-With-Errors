# Learning-With-Errors
The implementations here will have a series of algorithms to solve various variants of the LWE problem. 

The ```main``` files in each folder represent the use examples of several algorithms. 

The LPN (Learning Pairities with Noise) is solved using Arora Ge's algorithm, refer https://users.cs.duke.edu/~rongge/LPSN.pdf.

The LWE is given two different solution techniques. First the Arora Ge method as in the above paper. And then the Grobner basis method as demonstrated in the paper https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/1018.pdf.
